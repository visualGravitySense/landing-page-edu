# Portfolio Project Ideas for HTML/UX UI Class

A collaborative project with 8 students is a great opportunity to create something impressive for everyone's portfolio! Here are some project ideas that would showcase both technical HTML skills and UX/UI principles:

## 1. [[Community Resource Hub]]

Create a comprehensive resource website for your local community with interactive maps, event calendars, and service directories. Each student could own a section while maintaining a cohesive design system.

## 2. Digital Marketplace Platform

Build an e-commerce site where users can browse products, add items to cart, and simulate checkout. Include user authentication, product filtering, and responsive design for all devices.

## 3. Interactive Learning Platform

Develop an educational platform with interactive lessons, quizzes, progress tracking, and gamification elements. Each student could create content for different subjects.

## 4. Travel Experience App

Design a travel planning application with destination guides, itinerary building, budget tracking, and social sharing features. Focus on intuitive navigation and inspiring visuals.

## 5. Recipe Collection & Meal Planner

Create a cooking website with recipe browsing, meal planning calendars, shopping lists, and dietary preference filtering. Emphasize accessibility and user-friendly interaction.

## Project Structure Recommendation:

- Form 2-3 teams within your class
- Establish shared design guidelines (color schemes, typography, component library)
- Each student takes ownership of specific features
- Include documentation of your UX research and design process
- Implement responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop
- Add realistic content rather than placeholder text
- Test with actual users and iterate based on feedback

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these ideas or suggest alternatives based on your class's specific interests?
