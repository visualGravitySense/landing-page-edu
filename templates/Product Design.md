I understand you need to pivot your strategy from a quiz platform to an EdTech portal focused on business and marketing classes (like making business cards, etc.), and you need an MVP structure you can implement today using React, Vite, and Firebase.

Here's a streamlined MVP structure for your business education portal:

## Core MVP Components

**1. Authentication System**

- Simple login/signup with Firebase Auth
- User profiles with business type/interests

**2. Course Catalog**

- Featured courses section on homepage
- Category filtering (Marketing, Branding, Business Tools)
- Course cards with thumbnail, title, brief description

**3. Course Viewer**

- Video player component
- Text lesson component
- Simple progress tracking

**4. Basic Admin Panel**

- Course creation interface
- Content upload functionality
- User management

## Initial Course Content Focus

For your MVP, focus on these high-value, easy-to-create practical business courses:

- Business Card Design Fundamentals
- Creating a Simple Brand Kit
- Marketing Essentials for Small Business
- Digital Presence Quick-Start Guide

## Technical Implementation Plan

**Firebase Setup:**

- Authentication
- Firestore for course data & user progress
- Storage for video/image content

**React Components:**

1. Navigation/Header
2. CourseCard
3. CourseList
4. VideoLesson
5. TextLesson
6. UserProfile
7. AdminDashboard

**Basic Routes:**

- `/` - Home/Featured courses
- `/courses` - Course catalog
- `/courses/:id` - Individual course view
- `/profile` - User dashboard
- `/admin` - Admin panel (protected)

This structure keeps things minimal while providing the core functionality needed for a business education portal. You can implement this today with React, Vite, and Firebase, then gradually expand features as you validate the concept.
